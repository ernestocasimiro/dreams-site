              Dreams have always been an essential part of the human experience.
              Long before technology, nations, or written language, people dreamed.
              Dreams shaped beliefs, guided decisions, and inspired hope.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across cultures and generations, dreams have represented more than
              imagination. They reflect our desires, fears, purpose, and the
              direction we wish our lives to take.
